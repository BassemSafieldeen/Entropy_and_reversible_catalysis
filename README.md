There is a system S. The system is described by a quantum state ρ.

When does there exist a unitary that acts on the system S and another "catalytic" system C such that the state of S changes from ρ to ρ'?

The paper says: iff entropy(ρ') ≥ entropy(ρ).

The goal is to formalize the proof of this.

Strategy: Start by stating the theorem, then develop the API needed to remove all errors.
